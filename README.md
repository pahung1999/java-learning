## What is Java? Features & Variables
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that's designed to be platform-independent. Explore its features, such as portability, security, and robustness, along with the concept of variables.

## Data Types in Java
Java supports various data types:
- **Primitive Data Types**: Includes int, char, float, double, boolean, etc.
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Includes Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, etc.

## Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations.
- **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditional statements.

## Looping Statements
- **For Loop**: Iterates a block of code a specific number of times.
- **While Loop**: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: Simplifies iteration over a collection or an array.

## Conditional Statements
Learn how to control the flow of execution using if-else statements, switch cases, etc.

## Arrays in Detail
Understand how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in Java.

## Classes and Objects in Java
Explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming with classes and objects.

## Static vs Non-static
Learn the difference between static and non-static members in Java.

## Access Modifiers
Understand the four access modifiers:
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **Private**: Accessible only within its own class.
- **Protected**: Accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
- **Default**: Accessible only within its own package.

## Inheritance
- **Single Level Inheritance**: Learn how classes can inherit fields and methods from a single superclass.

## Constructors
Explore:
- **Default Constructor**: A constructor with no parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor with parameters for initializing objects.

## Method Overloading
Understand how to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (Compile Time Polymorphism).

## Constructor Overloading
Similar to method overloading, but with constructors.

## Method Overriding
Learn how to redefine a method in a subclass (Runtime Polymorphism).

## Interfaces
Explore how to define and implement interfaces in Java.

## Abstract Classes
Understand the purpose and use of abstract classes in Java.

## String Class and Usage
Learn about the String class and its commonly used methods.

## Collections Framework
Dynamic data structures that provide framework support for collections:
- **Lists**: ArrayList and LinkedList
- **Sets**: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
- **Maps**: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

## Exception Handling
Learn how to handle exceptions in Java to manage errors gracefully.
